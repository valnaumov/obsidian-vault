### Lead Software Engineer to help expand in Spain

Hi Valentin,  
  
KlearNow is pioneering “Logistics as a Service” (LaaS) by creating the industry’s first fully cloud-based digital network that can be used across the entire array of supply chain participants to simplify the transit of goods worldwide.  
  
KlearNow’s LaaS model/platform is powered by our proprietary artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) engine that automates the digitization of the many current siloed, manual, and paper-based processes ultimately turning a mass of disconnected data into a structured and adaptable resource for all partners.  
Over and above the core customs clearance solution, KlearNow is also providing consolidated freight visibility, data and document management and intra-port activity for efficient Drayage.  
We are looking for software professionals who are passionate about breaking the status quo and growing our platform vertically and into almost every continent in the world. This is a unique opportunity to help build the products and practices that will support this growth. In this role, you will build global products enabling expansion in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia.  
We are hiring engineers with experience in languages like Java, Scala, Go, Node.js, knowledge of web and mobile technologies such as ReactJS, React Native, Redux, HTML5, CSS, UI/UX development experience etc.  
I would like to know if this role aligns with your goals and expectations and if you are open to setting up a quick call to find out more. Attached here is my calendar for easy scheduling.  
  
Best,
