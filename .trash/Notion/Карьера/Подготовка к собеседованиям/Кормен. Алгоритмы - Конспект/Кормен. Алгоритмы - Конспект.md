# RAM model

Const time for each expression.

Worst case is more important, because:

- It happens often in real world: database search when the info is not present.
- The average case is often roughly as bad as the worst case (may differ by a fraction).

## Order of growth

- We therefore consider only the leading term of a formula (e.g., an 2 ), since the lower-order terms are relatively insignificant for large values of n.
- We also ignore the leading termâ€™s constant coefficient, since constant factors are less significant than the rate of growth in determining computational efficiency for large inputs.
    
    _For example, suppose that an algorithm implemented on a particular machine takes n 2 =100 C 100n C 17 microseconds on an input of size n. Although the coefficients of 1=100 for the n 2 term  
    and 100 for the n term differ by four orders of magnitude, the n 2 =100 term dominates the 100n term once n exceeds 10,000. Although 10,000 might seem large, it is smaller than the population of an average town. Many real-world problems have much larger input sizes.
