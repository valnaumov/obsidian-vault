- What can you do to make better estimates?
    
    I can spend more time planning. Planning is also work. I should be less optimistic with my estimates.
    
    And there are things you just cannot foresee, you have to make estimates with a margin. I mean, multiply to a factor to account for unexpected delays.
    
    There are moments when I want to fit more in less time. Say, I want to implement a certain feature up to my standards of quality. Meaning, something can be done just to work, but it can also be done with extensibility in mind. I want to make my work easier for me in the future and comfortable.
    
    I want to enjoy doing my work, but I mostly don’t doing this project. I barely learn anything. If we were 2 or 3 developers on the project, I could pass routine work to my less experienced colleagues. Since it’s totally done on money out of your pocket, you cannot afford it, I understand.
    
- Let’s go fixed?
    
    There’s an issue with fixed rate: everyone is expecting more for less. I would naturally want to spend less money to make more profit at the expense of quality. The feature will work, but is the code going to be maintainable? Is it going to be easily breakable. And on the other hand, you would expect the normal quality and a working feature and perhaps something else that you imply, but we have not discussed.
