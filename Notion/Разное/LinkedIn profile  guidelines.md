LinkedIn — a professional social network that allows you to be in touch with the companies you have always wanted to work at and be noticed by recruiters who seek world-class specialists from all around the globe. Whether you are actively searching for a new job or just "open" to interesting offers, your LinkedIn profile will bring you a lot of opportunities (and possibly your next employer). All you need to do is to set up the profile right — that's what we are going to do in this section.
# 1. What’s the point of LinkedIn, anyway?
LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the internet. You can use LinkedIn to **find the right job** or **internship**, **connect** and **strengthen professional relationships**, and **learn the skills** you need to **succeed in your career**.
**A complete LinkedIn profile** can help you connect with opportunities by showcasing your unique professional story through experience, skills, and education. Have you ever dreamt of working at FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google)? You can get this job on LinkedIn.
So, where do we start?
## 🎯 Task 1 — Get started
**Create your profile.** Yes, as simple as that. Signing up and creating your profile is the best way to begin using LinkedIn. Follow this 👉 [link](https://www.linkedin.com/signup).
If you are asked «Are you looking for a new job» when you are signing up, click «Now now» — we will configure it later.
  
- 🙅‍♀️ If LinkedIn is blocked in your country
    
    If LinkedIn is blocked in your country, you need a VPN to access it. Here is the [VPN](https://windscribe.com/yo/0unht2of) we use on our own and recommend you to use because it's simple, free and provides good user experience. Nice bonus — if you register with this link, you will get +1GB of data every month for free which is very useful when you surf the Internet.
    
## ✅ Checklist of successful task completion
- [x] You have used English to fill all the information, including
    - [x] Your name
    - [x] Latest job title
    - [x] Most recent company
- [ ] You have added the profile photo
    
    The best performing photos on LinkedIn are ones where you are looking directly at the camera and smiling — try to find one 🙋‍♂️
    
- [ ] You have added the background image
    
    If you have a photo of yourself working, giving a presentation, talking to somebody, or a group photo with your team from one of your previous jobs — that is a great photo to add 📷
    
    If no, try finding something that suits you on [this resource](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/workplace) 🔗

## ✅ Checklist of successful task completion
  
- [x] [**Edit profile URL**](https://i.ibb.co/G7FK9m8/edit-url.png)
    
    Basically, it's your username on the platform. You have one on Instagram, Facebook, ClubHouse, and other social media apps. If this username is a good one — just re-use it here, because being consistent is good!
    
    Keep it professional — use your real name. If needed, include your job title.

- [x] [**Make your profile visible to public**](https://i.ibb.co/svP8myM/visibility.png)
    
    After your profile URL is set, change the visibility settings. By default, your profile picture (or the entire profile) might be hidden from the public. Let the recruiters discover you!
    
- [x] [**Set the headline**](https://i.ibb.co/XjjdjBq/headline.png)
    
    The headline is the most important part for the first impression and appearing in recruiters searches. The formula of the headline is — `your current role | industry or area expertise | relevant job titles | unique value you provide`

- [x] [**Change the location**](https://i.ibb.co/ZHdVwqF/location.png)
    
    Do you want to work at a Silicon Valley-based company? Change your location to San Francisco. England? London. France? Paris. As simple as that. Now, when those companies' recruiters will search for the candidates, you will appear in their searches.
    
    Don't worry about not being in this location — most of the vacancies in 2021 are still remote. Or, if you actually plan to move there, you can tell that during the interview. No one is going to be upset. In fact, the company can actually help you to relocate — it's all discussible.
    
- [x] [**Set your industry**](https://i.ibb.co/P5nnp50/industry.png)
    
    Very simple step — just set the industry that you are working in or that suits you best.
    
- [x] [**Fill your contact info**](https://i.ibb.co/dg1RRJQ/contact-info.png)
    
    Same for the contact info — do it easier for recruiters to reach you outside LinkedIn.
    
- [ ] [**Add the About section**](https://i.ibb.co/5256V1h/about.png)
    
    Have you already studied the art of professional self-presentations? Great! It's a good place to give one. Here is 👉 the helper [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ey58zDpBgE).
    
    The formula of the perfect About section includes 4 parts:
    
    _Part 1: Who you are._ One sentence to introduce yourself professionally. Say the title of your current role and a brief statement of the kind of professional you are
    
    _Part 2: Why you are good at what you are doing._ 2-4 points that make you stand out based on the role you are interviewing for, with more emphasis on recent accomplishments.
    
    _Part 3: Technologies stack._ List the technologies you use in work or the tools you are experienced with.
    
    _Part 4: Call to action._ A short statement to encourage a recruiter to take the next step.

- [ ] [**Add the Featured section**](https://i.ibb.co/qnvRPCw/featured.png)
    
    Featured is a great section to demonstrate:
    
    — Projects you have been working on  
    — Articles you wrote or articles about you  
    — Public speeches or interviews you gave  
    — Your portfolio  
    — Your GitHub account  
    — Other things that can demonstrate what kind of professional you are or that can bring some light on your professional background  
    
    It's not recommended, but you can skip this section if you feel like there is nothing important to showcase. We are sure you have something — you can always ask your peers for advice in the group chat!
    
- [ ] [**Add your work experience**](https://i.ibb.co/FWDP0BG/work-experience.png)
    
    Good news! You have already created your resume, so you can just copy-paste this stuff right into LinkedIn's work experience section. Once again — yes, as simple as that 🙌
    
    That's, probably, one of the most important parts of your profile. Recruiters are going to spend some time reviewing this section to get to know you better as a professional, assess your skills and level of experience.
    
    You have all the content to leave a great impression. Don't even think about skipping this part!
    
- [ ] [**Add your education**](https://i.ibb.co/n31L97D/education.png)
    
    Where did you study? When have you graduated? What is your degree? What was the field of your study?
    
    Do you know the answers? Then, this section is going to be easy for you!
    
- [ ] [**Add licenses & certifications**](https://i.ibb.co/jLNnFpR/sertifications.png)
    
    Great place to list the courses, training, or other educational programs you took to be a better professional or certificates that showcase your expertise in some fields.
    
- [ ] [**Set your skills**](https://i.ibb.co/Bn5CFRP/skills.png)
    
    Quite an easy section — just pick the skills that are relevant to you or your role!
    
    Pro tip: skills help you to appear in recruiters' searches. Try adding all 50 of them to increase your chances of being noticed.
    
- [ ] [**Add the languages you speak — don't forget about English**](https://i.ibb.co/D5Dk92b/languages.png)
    
    This section is self-explanatory — just add languages you speak!
    
    When you add English, set proficiency to the level not lower than `Full professional proficiency` — the higher, the better!
    
- [ ] [**The final step — set you are open to work**](https://i.ibb.co/kczBBT2/open-to-work.png)
    
    Congratulations 🎉 your profile is almost set up! Now it's time to tell the world that you are open to work and ready to take new opportunities. Here are the rules to follow:
    
    — Specify all relevant job titles to appear in more searches. For example, if you are a React Developer, add the following job titles: `React Developer, Software Engineer, Software Developer, Frontend Engineer, Frontend Developer, JavaScript Engineer, JavaScript Developer, Web Developer`.
    
    — Job locations: add all cities you want to work in and make sure to check the «I’m open to remote work» checkbox.
    
    — Start date: set to «Immediately, I’m actively applying» to encourage the recruiters to contact you about the vacancies they have.
    
    — Job types: «Full Time» and «Contract» are the options to go if you are looking for a full-time job.
    
    — Choose who sees you’re open: if you feel comfortable about letting everyone know you are open to work and you know there are going to be no problems with your current company, choose «All LinkedIn members» to attract recruiters' attention. If no, choose «Recruiters only».
    
    — That's it! Are you ready to appear in recruiters' searches and get hired to a company of your dreams? Then press the «Add to profile» button to get the ball rolling 🚀
    
  
❤️ After everything is done, send your profile to the group chat to get the love from your coursemates and feedback from your teacher.

# 3. Networking and job search
Now, when your profile is stunning, you are ready to start using LinkedIn by building your professional network and applying for promising jobs. Without further ado, let's take a look at the tasks 👇
  
## 🙋‍♂️ Task 3 — Start building your network
LinkedIn is a place to build your professional network and develop your personal brand. To do that, you need to connect with people. Here is what you can do:
  
- [ ] Begin by adding your friends, family, past or current coworkers to your network. Try finding someone you know on the [My Network page](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/).
- [ ] Connect with your course mates 👨‍🎓👩‍🎓 You have seen their profiles in the group chat (you should have sent yours as well) — just open them and press the «Connect» button 🚀
- [ ] You can also follow people, companies, or topics you like by navigating directly to the [Follow fresh perspectives page](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/follow/), which displays recommended sources to follow
- [ ] Pro tip: follow the companies you want to work at and like or comment their publications. If you do, when you apply for their job positions, you will be marked as an «Interested» candidate which can give you a little bit of advantage over other people 🤯
## ✅ Checklist of successful task completion
- [ ] You have sent connection requests to you course mates
- [ ] You have followed a company you would like to word at
  
## 👨‍💻 Task 4 — Find a job
If you’re looking for a new professional opportunity, you can get started on your job search on LinkedIn. You can use LinkedIn to research companies and reach out to the hiring community. You can also apply directly for roles, save job searches, and notify your connections and recruiters that you’re open for job opportunities.
  
- [ ] Go to the [Jobs Search page](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/)
- [ ] Press [All filters](https://i.ibb.co/N1rmmq6/filters.png) and configure them to suit your needs
- [ ] Find and save up to 10 vacancies you would like to apply in the nearest future
- [ ] Pro tip: switch on the [Under 10 Applicants](https://i.ibb.co/rcykPwn/under-10.png) toggle to display less competitive job offerings — the chances of being noticed by the company are much higher here because those companies are not overwhelmed with the number of applications they receive!
  
## ✅ Checklist of successful task completion
- [ ] You have saved up to 10 vacancies you would like to apply in the nearest future
- [ ] You have sent them to your crash course teacher on Telegram
