## [Online Video Editor Research - Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Online-Video-Editor-Research_%7E0188ceee74a3b53bc3?source=rss)
Hi there,
I'm trying to understand the tech stack of online video editors like  
(Wave.video and Biteable) to get a better understanding of how they have been developed. There is also  
https://waymark.com/videos/burst15_4x5.default/edit  
I run a video production company and am interested in how we can get our AfterEffects templates online for users to change and manipulate in a  
single-page app.  
What we need: a technical report and explanation on how these editors  
are built, and if there are any SDKs that would give us a start. This is essentially a research project.  
Functionality that will give you a better idea of what we'd be looking to build:
- Project: Video project can be played back, and paused as a preview.
- Template: User can edit text within video template.
- Template: User can replace a clip with other media (images and video clips).
- Template: User can change text colour (per frame)
- Template: User can change font (global setting).
- Template: User can change video ratio (will load a different version of the template).

## [Create dynamic rendered videos from web app uploaded photos](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-dynamic-rendered-videos-from-web-app-uploaded-photos_%7E01b289ad7d0f013f36?source=rss)
  
Creating a web application to upload 3 photos -&gt; send to video  
rendering machine (like after effects, or any online solution for  
rendering) -&gt; automatically send rendered video with uploaded  
images back to user to see video with his uploaded footage included  
inside the video as pictures on the wall. This must be fully automatic.  
So I need someone to create the masking/macro in After effects, then a  
json /java script that gets transferred. See this explanation:  
https://www.themarketingtechnologist.co/creating-dynamic-videos-using-javascript-and-after-effects-the-basics/  
It will be used by multiple users simultaniasly and videos must be  
rendered and sent to correct user. See uploaded attachment for  
explanation where the photos must be placed in the video when viewed by  
user. They see their own photos. Please, if you have the knowledge,  
contact me asap.
