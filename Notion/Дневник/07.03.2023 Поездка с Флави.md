Съездил с Флави в Белогорку, в ущелье. Красиво. Она сама — сложная женщина, как я и предполагал. Планов не имею.
Смотрю гугл-панорамы Австралии и просто охуеваю от красоты и ухоженности городов. Но очень дорогая жизнь.

> Sydney native here. Sydney (Australia in general) has alot of good things. Safety, job opportunities, you don't need a degree here to make a good living. Weather is pretty good, mild winters. bureaucracy isn't that bad, food quality here is some of the best in the world. Bad things: cost of living is insane, real estate prices are some of the most expensive in the world. People are generally friendly but I wouldn't say they are "open minded" or "warm" compare to other cultures. Has no real culture or much history. I think it's boring here. No much to do. Very isolated from rest of the world. Even if you have a high income I still think there are far better options. To visit though you will love it!
