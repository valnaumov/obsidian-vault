# Intro
I am a software developer with 7 years of experience based in **Russia**.
My focus area for the past few years has been desktop software development using the JavaFX platform, but I'm also skilled in web development. I mostly use the Java platform and am looking forward to advancing my Kotlin skills, but a task should define the methods and I am open to using other tools.
I am a result-oriented person with strong debugging skills, but I am also best motivated when I see the impact on the end users.
