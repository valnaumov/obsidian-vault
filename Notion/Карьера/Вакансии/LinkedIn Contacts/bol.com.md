Dear Valentin  
  
I’m contacting you for the position of Software Engineer at  
[Bol.com](http://bol.com/)
because at Linkedin you're 'open for a new opportunity' right? :-)  
  
We are expanding (heavily!) in the next few months, so perhaps this the  
right time to join us as a Software or a Full Stack Engineer.  
  
Relocation to the Netherlands is required but don't worry; We take care  
of it!  
[Bol.com](http://bol.com/)
is the biggest online retailer and e-commerce marketplace in the  
Netherlands and Belgium. On a total of 2400 Bol.commers over 700  
colleagues work in IT in +- 120 fully autonomous agile teams. You can  
imagine IT and software engineering in particular are at the core of our  
business ;-)  
  
How does IT work in bol? Our fully autonomous teams are end-to-end  
responsible for one or more of our 800+ Microservices. From requirements  
analysis and designing the solution, to coding and testing and ensuring  
it stays running. Our stack consists – among others – of Java,  
Microservices, Docker, Jenkins, MongoDB, GCP and some Kotlin and Go.  
  
You can take a look here on how we do things:

The video is from some time ago, but our way of working is still the same :-)  
  
Should the above sound interesting, perhaps we could schedule a (video)call?  
  
Looking forward to your reply!
