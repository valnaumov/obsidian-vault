### Contract Opportunity - React Developer
Hi Valentin,  
  
I am a technical recruitment consultant for the recruitment firm Airswift.  
  
Airswift has over 60+ offices globally with circa 7000 contractors working through ourselves.  
  
We are currently supporting a leading Tech Company, known Worldwide for their projects. They are expanding their remote team to include the appointment of a React Developer.  
  
I spotted your profile and would like to speak to you about the opening to understand if it could be of interest?  
  
They are looking to hire someone on an initial 3-month contract with potential for extension.  
  
Could we schedule a quick call to discuss this? If so, what time works best for you?  
  
Additionally, if you have a CV to hand, please send over via LinkedIn so that I can review before we speak  
  
If this role does not appeal to you, and you know anyone who may be interested in this opportunity, please feel free to pass over their details and I will happily get in touch with them.  
  
Thanks Valentin, and looking forward to connecting with you.
